# MAHABHARATA ANIMATION STYLE GUIDE
*Inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender (aka ATLA)*

## OVERALL ART DIRECTION

Our Mahabharata adaptation combines the mythic grandeur of ancient Indian epic storytelling with the accessible, expressive animation style that made Avatar: The Last Airbender so beloved. The style blends traditional Indian artistic influences with modern animation techniques to create a unique visual identity.

### Core Aesthetic Principles

- **Dynamic Camera Work**: Cinematic framing with dramatic angles during action sequences
- **Fluid Animation**: Smooth movement prioritizing key emotional and action moments
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Strong use of light and shadow to enhance storytelling

## CHARACTER DESIGN

### General Principles

- Characters have proportions similar to ATLA's adult characters (approximately 6-7 heads tall)
