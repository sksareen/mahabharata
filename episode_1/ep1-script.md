# Storyboard Planning for Mahabharata Episode 1 - Scene 1

For professional storyboarding, each storyboard typically consists of 1-3 image panels depending on the complexity of the scene. For this first scene introducing Vyasa and Ganesha, I'll plan approximately 25-30 storyboards with detailed panel information.

### Storyboard 7: Brahma's Suggestion
**Panels:** 1

### Storyboard 13: Ganesha's Confidence
**Panels:** 1
1. Ganesha smiling confidently

**Dialogue:**

3. Ganesha's face showing concentration and slight confusion as he pauses with the quill
4. Montage showing scrolls filling up, different times of day through window, and growing pile of manuscripts

**Dialogue:**
NARRATOR: "And so began their collaboration. Vyasa composed complex verses when he needed time to think, forcing Ganesha to pause and contemplate. Through this clever arrangement, the Mahabharata gradually took shape."

### Storyboard 16: Transition to the Story
**Panels:** 2
1. Pull back from the ashram to show the passing of time (changing seasons)
2. Dissolve to the kingdom of Hastinapur

**Dialogue:**
NARRATOR: "Long, long ago, there lived a king named Shantanu who ruled over a vast kingdom in northern India. Hastinapur was the capital of this kingdom."

This covers the introduction scene with 19 storyboards (38 panels total). For a complete first scene, we would continue with introducing King Shantanu and his first encounter with Ganga, but this gives you a detailed template for how to approach the storyboarding process.

Each storyboard can be presented on a single page with the panels drawn sequentially, along with notes for camera movements, transitions, and any special effects. Dialogue and narration should be noted beneath each relevant panel.
